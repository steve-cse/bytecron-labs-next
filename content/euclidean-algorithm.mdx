The algorithm states that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers can be derived using the following identity:

$$
\gcd(n_1, n_2) = \gcd(n_1 - n_2, n_2)
$$

where $n_1 > n_2$

The difference is always divisible by the GCD, i.e.,

$$
(n_1 - n_2) \bmod \gcd(n_1, n_2) = 0
$$

## Example: GCD for $n_1 = 7$ and $n_2 = 2$

$$
\gcd(7, 2) = \gcd(7 - 2, 2) = \gcd(5, 2)
$$

$$
\gcd(5, 2) = \gcd(5 - 2, 2) = \gcd(3, 2)
$$

$$
\gcd(3, 2) = \gcd(3 - 2, 2) = \gcd(1, 2)
$$

$$
\gcd(2, 1) = \gcd(2 - 1, 1) = \gcd(1, 1)
$$

$$
\gcd(1, 1) = \gcd(1 - 1, 1) = \gcd(0, 1)
$$

**Hence, the GCD of $n_1 = 7$ and $n_2 = 2$ is 1.**

## Optimization with Modulus

Instead of repeated subtraction, we can use the modulus operator:

$$
\gcd(7 \bmod 2, 2) = \gcd(1, 2)
$$

The code for the algorithm can be written as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int GCD(int n1, int n2) {
        while (n1 != 0 && n2 != 0) {
            if (n1 > n2)
                n1 = n1 % n2;
            else
                n2 = n2 % n1;
        }
        return (n2 == 0) ? n1 : n2;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**

$$
O(\log(\min(n_1, n_2)))
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are given numbers. Because in every iteration, the algorithm is dividing the larger number with the smaller number, resulting in logarithmic time complexity.

**Space Complexity:**

$$
O(1)
$$

Since only a couple of variables are used, i.e., constant space.
